## Primary Question
This analysis examines the effect of election format on voter turnout. Specifically, do primaries result in higher voter turnout compared to caucus elections?

## Key Takeaways
Our findings suggest a considerable effect of election format on voter turnout. A 15.7 percentage point increase is enormous considering that the mean voter turnout for democratic caucus elections for 2008, 2016, and 2020 is only 5.6 percent. While voting regulations continue to be a state-regulated feature of presidential elections, the shift to having fewer caucuses and more typical primaries has continued throughout time and should continue to be monitored as voter turnout is an important feature of a democracy. 

While our Colorado case study does not provide causal evidence for the effect of election format on specific demographic groups, it does support an association between election format and increased voter turnout for young millennial populations. Millennial voter turnout has the potential to impact the outcome of many elections as millennial voters tend to vote differently than older generations.
